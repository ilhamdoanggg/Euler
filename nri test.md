Driving at an intersection can be dangerous. Many collisions happen at an intersection without a traffic light. A common cause is the assumption of each driver that there is no vehicle or, if there is, the other driver will give way.

Driving at an intersection without slowing down or by tailgating another vehicle is unsafe because:

Select one:

a.Most collisions are caused by drivers following too close to the vehicle in front.
b.Without fully slowing down or stopping at an intersection, there might be no sufficient time and space to stop and avoid a collision.
